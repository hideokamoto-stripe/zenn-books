## Imagine the Story of the E-Commerce Site Development

Before we dive into the workshop, let's imagine the context for developing this system.

You've been assigned to an e-commerce project for a furniture sales company.

This company produces high-quality furniture made-to-order and delivers it to customers upon request.

Since the website doesn't have a lot of traffic, there's no need for inventory management or order limitations at this stage.

Once you've prepared the product sales system, other team members will begin working on the site's design and content.

Therefore, the goal is to create a product sales feature with a short schedule and minimal code.

Have you got the idea?

Now, let's explore how to integrate product sales functionality using Stripe into your e-commerce site.
